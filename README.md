# ez-venv
Super easy script that can make a virtual env


# Quick install


  * `cd <YOUR DIRECTORY>`
  * Download and install in one line:
    * `curl -X GET https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zackees/make_venv/main/make_venv.py | python`
  * To enter the environment run:
    * `source activate.sh`


# Notes
    This script is tested to work using python2 and python3 from a fresh install. The only side effect
    of running this script is that virtualenv will be globally installed if it isn't already.
